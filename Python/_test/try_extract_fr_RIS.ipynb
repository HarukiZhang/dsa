    "read records from RIS format paper records;\r\n",
    "need to automatically get all the indices of each item of paper information;\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### problem:\r\n",
    "If use dict to collect each paper record, so that one dict contains only single record, after file reading, it is a little bit difficult to convert the each dict to pandas.DataFrame; so I have use `dict.values()` to convert each dict into list in order to convert to DataFrame to save file;\r\n",
    "#### Initially,\r\n",
    "the reason that I used dict to collect each paper record is that: \r\n",
    "- it seemed better to leave a blank when a specific item of inforamtion is absent in the record, so I think I can use key::value pair to set the blank;\r\n",
    "#### However, the list can work the same:\r\n",
    "- just need to initiate a list that has the same length of the scale, and \r\n",
    "- for reading each item, use `scale.index(line[:2])` to index the position where a specific item of paper information should be insert to;\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Summary:\r\n",
    "I just wander in a user-customized function, it seems `list` can do every when you need a sequence; so in what situation or condition, it is better to use `dict` or `set` ? Well, I just think the usage of these two kinds seems to be largely overlapped by `list`."
